<h3>Job Title: CEO construction company</h3>
<p>Sammy Sosa has been running a humble construction company for 5 years in Fort Lauderdale area. He's been looking to expand projects to the greater South Florida, but he's short on sells staff and feels the need for a website to expand his presence.</p>

<h3>Frustration</h3>
<p>Sammy has been focused on construction and property management since he started the company but he lacks knowledge in modern web development. He is also a very busy person and doesn't have time to research his market for the web.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Sammy wants to expand the exposure of his company's services to the greater South Florida region and he believes an online presence built with modern web practices can help him meet that goal. The research that he and his team have done for web services in the area has lead them to the conclusion that Massimo Bouchentouf Web Services LLC is the best in the area.</p>

<h3>User Story</h3>
<p>As a user, I need to decide if Simo Bouchentouf meets the the requirements needed for my goal.</p>
